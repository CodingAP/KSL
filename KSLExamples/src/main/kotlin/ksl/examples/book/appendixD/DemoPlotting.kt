/**
 * This file demonstrates how to create many of the plots that
 * are available within the ksl.utilities.io.plotting package.
 * The KSL uses the [lets-plot library](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin)
 * as its underlying plotting platform.
 *
 * The KSL wraps the lets-plot functionality into a set of classes to create commonly
 * used plots within simulation. The KSL has classes that facilitate the construction of
 * the following plots.
 *
 *  - ACFPlot
 *  - BoxPlot
 *  - CDFDiffPlot
 *  - ConfidenceIntervalsPlot
 *  - DensityPlot
 *  - DiscreteCDFPlot
 *  - DotPlot
 *  - ECDFPlot
 *  - FitDistPlot
 *  - FunctionPlot
 *  - HistogramDensityPlot
 *  - HistogramPlot
 *  - IntegerFrequencyPlot
 *  - MultiBoxPlot
 *  - ObservationsPlot
 *  - PartialSumsPlot
 *  - PMFComparisonsPlot
 *  - PMFPlot
 *  - PPPlot
 *  - QQPlot
 *  - ScatterPlot
 *  - StateFrequencyPlot
 *  - StateVariablePlot
 *  - WelchPlot
